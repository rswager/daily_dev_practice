The **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Pattern Matching Algorithm**
is an efficient method to find occurrences of a *pattern string* within a *text string*.
Unlike the naive search which can re-check previously matched characters,
KMP avoids redundant comparisons by preprocessing the pattern.

### ✅ Key Concepts:

1. **Prefix Table (also called LPS: Longest Prefix Suffix array)**
   This table stores the length of the longest prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix up to that point.
   It helps skip characters intelligently when a mismatch happens.

2. **Avoids Re-checking**
   When a mismatch occurs, KMP uses the prefix table to decide how far to "slide" the pattern,
   skipping unnecessary comparisons.

### 🔍 Example:

Search for pattern `"ABABCABAB"` in text `"ABABDABACDABABCABAB"`
KMP will avoid restarting from index 0 of the pattern when it finds a mismatch.

### 🧠 Time Complexity:

* **Preprocessing (LPS array):** `O(m)` where `m` is the length of the pattern
* **Search:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the text
  **Total:** `O(n + m)`

Example of LPS calculation:
Absolutely! Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of the LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array construction for the pattern **"AAACAAAAAC"**, showing the current pattern with `pattern[index]` and `pattern[length]` **highlighted** at each step.

We'll use:

* `^` to mark `pattern[index]`
* `*` to mark `pattern[length]`

### Pattern: `"AAACAAAAAC"`

Initialize:

```python
lps = [0] * 10
length = 0
index = 1
```

---

### 🔁 Step-by-step

#### Step 1: index = 1, length = 0

Compare `pattern[1] = A` with `pattern[0] = A`

```
pattern: A A A C A A A A A C
           * ^
```

✅ Match → `length = 1`, `lps[1] = 1`

---

#### Step 2: index = 2, length = 1

Compare `pattern[2] = A` with `pattern[1] = A`

```
pattern: A A A C A A A A A C
             * ^
```

✅ Match → `length = 2`, `lps[2] = 2`

---

#### Step 3: index = 3, length = 2

Compare `pattern[3] = C` with `pattern[2] = A`

```
pattern: A A A C A A A A A C
               * ^
```

❌ Mismatch → fallback `length = lps[1] = 1`

---

#### Retry Step 3: index = 3, length = 1

Compare `pattern[3] = C` with `pattern[1] = A`

```
pattern: A A A C A A A A A C
           *     ^
```

❌ Mismatch → fallback `length = lps[0] = 0`

---

#### Final Retry Step 3: index = 3, length = 0

Compare `pattern[3] = C` with `pattern[0] = A`

```
pattern: A A A C A A A A A C
         *       ^
```

❌ Mismatch → `lps[3] = 0`, no match

---

#### Step 4: index = 4, length = 0

Compare `pattern[4] = A` with `pattern[0] = A`

```
pattern: A A A C A A A A A C
         *         ^
```

✅ Match → `length = 1`, `lps[4] = 1`

#### Step 5: index = 5, length = 1

Compare `pattern[5] = A` with `pattern[1] = A`

```
pattern: A A A C A A A A A C
             *         ^
```

✅ Match → `length = 3`, `lps[6] = 3`

               *         ^
```

❌ Mismatch → fallback `length = lps[2] = 2`
