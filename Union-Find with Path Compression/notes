A **Union-Find** (also known as **Disjoint Set Union**, or **DSU**) is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It's very useful for problems involving **connectivity**, like **Kruskal's algorithm** for finding minimum spanning trees, or determining if adding an edge will create a cycle in a graph.

### Key Operations:

1. **Find**: Determine which subset an element belongs to.
2. **Union**: Merge two subsets into a single subset.

### Path Compression:

To make `find()` faster, **path compression** flattens the structure of the tree whenever you call `find`. This means each node directly points to the root of its set, which makes future operations faster.

### Why Path Compression Matters

Without path compression, the tree could become skewed (like a linked list), making operations O(n). With path compression (and union by rank), **all operations are nearly constant time** — specifically, **O(α(n))**, where α is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly.
